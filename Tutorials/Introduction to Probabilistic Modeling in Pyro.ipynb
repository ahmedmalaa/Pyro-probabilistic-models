    "**Pyro** is a [universal probabilistic programming language (PPL)](https://pyro.ai/) in Python with a PyTorch backend. It enables flexible implementation for deep probabilistic models, which unifies the strengths of deep learning and probabilistic models. As stated in its [website](https://pyro.ai/), Pyro was designed based on the following principles:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universal**: Pyro can represent *any* computable probability distribution.\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Pyro scales to *large data sets* with little overhead.\n",
    "- **Minimal**: Pyro is implemented with a small core of powerful, composable abstractions.\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Pyro aims for automation and control. "
