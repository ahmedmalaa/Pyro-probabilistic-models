Each datapoint is generated by a (local) latent random variable $\\boldsymbol{z}_i$. There is also a parameter $\\theta$, which is global in the sense that all the datapoints depend on it (which is why it is drawn outside the plate). Note that since $\\theta$ is a parameter, it's not something we're being Bayesian about. **What's of particular importance here is that we allow for each $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$ to depend on $\\boldsymbol{z}_i$ in a complex, non-linear way.** In practice this dependency will be parameterized by a (deep) neural network with parameters $\\theta$.
